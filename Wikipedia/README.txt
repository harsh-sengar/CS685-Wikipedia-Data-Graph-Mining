All the programs are python program and also shell script file is included which will run entire assignment in one go for every question program. You can invoke any program from within the shell file. The programs should run in the Linux operating system.

Dependencies - Python Libraries (json, numpy, pandas, difflib, collections, requests, pandas, csv, operator, networkx)

Language - python3

Command - sh ./assign2.sh

Only above command is required in order to run the complete assignment. But for convenience I have also included the .ipynb file to run and see code in Jupiter notebook also.


Q1 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q1.sh)
Q2 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q2.sh)
Q3 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q3.sh)
Q4 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q4.sh)
Q5 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q5.sh)
Q6 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q6.sh)
Q7 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q7.sh)
Q8 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q8.sh)
Q9 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q9.sh)
Q10 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q10.sh)
Q11 can be run using command (Command - sh ./Q11.sh)


Each and every code is available in .py, .ipynb, .sh formats. And using all dependencies can be easily run.
